        <section class="history-container">
            <div class="history-details">
                <p>When we talk of World Citi Colleges, we are actually referring to an education system that 
                    consists of three campuses—WCC Antipolo, WCC Caloocan, and WCC Quezon City.</p>
                <p>Of the three campuses of the WCC Education System, WCC-Quezon City is hailed as the 
                    mother campus. It used to be known as Quezon City Medical Center and Colleges, Inc. 
                    (QCMCC); and before that, as Medical Center of Quezon City (MCQC) as evidenced by its 
                    Certificate of Incorporation issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 15, 
                    1971. Subsequent to MCQC's incorporation, a permit to operate a 100-bed capacity hospital 
                    was issued by the Bureau of Medical Service of the Department of Health.</p>
                <p>In June 1979, its Articles of Incorporation were amended changing its corporate name to 
                    Quezon City Medical Center and Colleges, Inc. (QCMCC). Consequently, it established its first 
                    college - the College of Nursing.</p>

                <h1>The New Management</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="history-details">
                <p>There was a change of ownership and management in March 1986. The inspiring 
                    leadership of the Guico family ushered in a new vision and fresh enthusiasm that gave impetus 
                    to the rapid and consistent growth of the institution. From school year 1986 to the present, 
                    remarkable changes have continued to be realized through the concerted managerial acumen 
                    of the dynamic corporate leadership of Quezon City Medical Center and Colleges.</p>

                <h1>Transitions and Trajectories</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="history-details">
                <p>From an old two-storey hospital building, the medical center stands tall and proud in its 
                    imposing 15-storey edifice serving hundreds of patients per day. The reputation of the hospital 
                    as a respected health care provider in the country is proven by the unfailing trust and 
                    confidence of satisfied clients and patients.</p>
                <p>In the school division, new courses were offered. These include baccalaureate degrees in 
                    Physical Therapy, Radiologic Technology, Nutrition and Dietetics, Pharmacy, Medical 
                    Technology, Biology, Chemistry, Hotel and Restaurant Management and Psychology. It also 
                    offers courses in Midwifery, Respiratory Therapy, Health Aide and Medical Transcription. Many 
                    QCMCC alumni topped their respective Board Exams.</p>
                <p>Indeed, QCMCC was envisioned to be a center of excellence in health care and education 
                    so that it will be preferred for its innovativeness, dynamism, competence and pro-activeness, 
                    admired in the way it cares for people and esteemed for its compassion for everyone.</p>
                <p>Nationwide, QCMCC is respected for its integrity and social responsibility. It is the country's 
                    first Medical Hotel, a mission field, and a living testimony of God's goodness.</p>
                <p>In the year 2001, as a tribute to world-class Filipino professionals, Quezon City Medical 
                    Center and Colleges became World Citi Inc. Its twin institutions are now known as World Citi 
                    Medical Center and World Citi Colleges.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="history-details">
                <p>World Citi Colleges is an emerging educational system with sister institutions and 
                    campuses. These include WCC in Caloocan City (formerly Holy Trinity School) and WCC in 
                    Antipolo City (formerly Westminster College)</p>
                <p>Holy Trinity School is a long-established institution in basic education aspiring to venture in 
                    tertiary education. It was founded by Mrs. Virginia Datiles Vda. de Lizardo in 1969. The school 
                    was “orphaned” when President Datiles died in 1995. The Board of Directors turned over the 
                    management and ownership of the school to the Guico family in 1997 and since then, it has 
                    grown by leaps and bounds.</p>
                <p>Westminster Colleges of the Philippines was established last June 17, 2000. The institution 
                    offers baccalaureate degrees in Business Administration, Accountancy, Elementary and 
                    Secondary Education, Criminology and Nursing. Under the supervision of the WCC Education 
                    System, the college aims to develop young people who will become the country's leaders in the 
                    future.</p>
                <p>The history of World Citi Colleges is a continuing saga of transitions that validate its stability 
                    and trajectories that prove its aggressive and innovative spirit. Rooted in its calling “to serve 
                    and to care,” it continues its purpose-driven pursuit of excellence.</p>

            <h1>WCC Philosophy and Credo</h1>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <section class="history-container">
            <div class="history-details">
                <p>World Citi Colleges is an institution founded in the uncompromising belief that God is the 
                    Lord of history and therefore nothing happens in human life without divine providence and 
                    intervention.</p>
                <p>WCC stands on the conviction that its educational vision and mission constitute a high 
                    calling and ministry. Bound by its dedication to educational excellence, it is mandated to lead in 
                    holistic and professional education that is Christian in foundation, nationalist in perspective, 
                    competency-based and research-driven in curriculum, scientific in emphasis, global in scope 
                    and culturally diverse in orientation.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we envision WCC graduates to be truly Christ-centered in commitment and 
                    character, proven in professional competence and Filipino in identity and consciousness.</p>
                <p>As World Citizens, WCC alumni exceed standard expectations in their fields of 
                    specialization. With superior academic training and intellectual prowess, they rise above the 
                    throng in their passion for achievement, always excelling in performance and leadership.</p>
                <p>Imbued in their WCC culture is the profound concern for ecological and socio-economic 
                    justice, human life and dignity. Thus, World Citizens respect all people as persons of sacred 
                    worth and because of this they cross boundaries to remove all prejudices on the basis of creed, 
                    class, race, or gender. This lifestyle and philosophy is rooted in the WCC Christian vocation 
                    embodied in its college hymn: “Called to serve and to care.</p>

                WCC Aerotech College (WCC ATC) started off as just a training school in 2005 which only had two hobby 
                aircrafts to service its students. It gained its current name in 2008 with the increasing number of its students. 
                The Caloocan campus serves as the breeding ground for aircraft mechanics.

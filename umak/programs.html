                WCC Aerotech College (WCC ATC) started off as just a training school in 2005 which only had two hobby 
                aircrafts to service its students. It gained its current name in 2008 with the increasing number of its students. 
                The Caloocan campus serves as the breeding ground for aircraft mechanics.
